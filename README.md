# xg-lesioni

A library for QAOA with bayesian optimisation.

## Usage

### Poetry

- Open the terminal and enter the repo with ```cd <path-to-this-repo-folder>```
- Execute the command ```poetry install``` in order to install a poetry virtual environment with all the required packages installed
- Run ```poetry run python src/main_qutip.py --help``` to have an overview of the available arguments

NOTE: In order to install the poetry environment you need Python **3.7.X** on your computer, in order to make [Pulser](https://pypi.org/project/pulser/) properly work. If you don't have Python 3.7.X, it is strongly recommended to use Docker.
